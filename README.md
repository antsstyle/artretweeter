# ArtRetweeter
A tool for artists to use, focused on the Twitter collections feature and retweeting previous posts.

The server-side part is written in PHP and uses TwitterOAuth (https://twitteroauth.com/).

The client application is written in Java and requires the Java Runtime Environment (https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).

## Using ArtRetweeter

You will need the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed.

Download the latest release from the Releases tab on the right, unzip it into a directory of your choice, and run the .jar file

## What are Twitter Collections?

Twitter Collections are a feature for listing tweets of your choice (rather than the Lists feature, which only allows you to put users in a list but not control which tweets are in the list).

Collections support three ordering types: tweets sorted by newest-first chronologically, oldest-first chronologically, or reverse curation order (i.e. the tweets are in the order you add them, with the latest one you've added at the top of the list).

Here is an example collection: https://twitter.com/antsstyle/timelines/1410230429718695941
