# artretweeter
A tool for artists to use, focused on the Twitter collections feature and retweeting previous posts. The latter - retweeting - will be implemented soon.

The server-side part is written in PHP and requires TwitterOAuth (https://twitteroauth.com/). 

The client application is written in Java and requires the Java Runtime Environment (https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
